                sleeping all the time and urinating excessively, we brought her to see
                the specialist at Wisdom. After running a blood test, Dr. Winthrop
                confirmed what we all feared - Samantha was showing signs of diabetes.</p>

            <p class="article_smalltext">The staff at Wisdom worked tirelessly to
                determine why our three-year old bulldog, Roxie, started going
                into sudden kidney failure. They stabilized her and provided fluids
                until her kidneys were again functioning normal, but it was still a
                mystery as to what caused her health to decline so quickly.</p>

            <p class="article_smalltext">Wisdom Pet Medicine is the only clinic
                around that will even book pet fish for appointments. When our 13-year old
                goldfish, McAllister, turned from silvery white to an angry red, we
                called around, urgently trying to find a veterinarian who could help.
                Wisdom not only got us in the same day, but also was able to diagnose
                McAllister as having a severe case of septicemia.</p>
